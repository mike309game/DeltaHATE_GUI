# DeltaHATE GUI version
Yet another Deltarune corruptor! (that can corrupt other GameMaker Studio games too!)

This is basically [this](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/blob/master/UndertaleModTool/SampleScripts/DeltaHATE.csx) script from [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/) but portted as an standalone program with options.

The only problem is that it doesn't really have a "power meter" so you'll always get [the](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/507353685228126218/528569210679590912/unknown.png)[max](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/299645962765205515/528632282123337759/unknown.png) [chaos.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/299645962765205515/528632474582908928/unknown.png)

##IMPORTANT
In case you get softlocked in a part of the game even when shuffling the game many times, you'd probably want to use a clean data.win of the game to progress beyond that part.

(and I'd really appreciate if you contacted me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/npBTeGu) and reported the softlock to me and I'll see what I can do.)

## TODO (there's some more in the TODO.txt file in the release)

-=DELTARUNE

-Background shuffle in unstable mode

-Remove background images in sprite list

-alright turns out unstable shuffle [really is unstable](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/507353685228126218/528572036101177354/unknown.png) (this is the exact part which i saw in a video that the game softlocked). I really need to do something about this since unstable shuffle is the default option.

-=GLOBAL

-POWER METER

-Keeps running after closing, really need a fix to that

-Add an customizable sprite exception for both modes

-Add an exception for font graphics in stable mode (they're just too big and just fills up the screen in the game)

-Put the "deltahate_logo.png" file inside the exe
