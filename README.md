# DeltaHATE GUI version
Yet another Deltarune corruptor! (that can corrupt other GameMaker Studio games too!)

This is basically [this](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/blob/master/UndertaleModTool/SampleScripts/DeltaHATE.csx) script from [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/) but as an standalone program with options.

Releases are here: https://github.com/mike309game/DeltaHATE_GUI/releases

## TODO

-=DELTARUNE

-Background shuffle in unstable mode

-Remove background images in sprite list

-=GLOBAL

-Add an customizable sprite exception for both modes

-Add an exception for font graphics in stable mode (they're just too big and just fills up the screen in the game)
